Blood Donor Central 
http://blooddonorcentral.org/ aims to eradicate blood donor shortage from India by connecting repeat/regular volunteers with people in need using digital media

-

> **How?:**
> - bloodcare is a mobile solution to crowd-source help from its users to drive blood donations in times of need
> - Once installed, users create their profile and indicate their blood type and willingness to donate
> - When a person in need places a request in the app, users in the neighbourhood would receive blood alerts through the app indicating the specific blood type needed, with a map function to find the location

> **How to incentivize /encourage blood donors:**
> - The app allows users to check-in their donations by scanning a QR code on posters at the blood banks. This allows the user to track the number of lives she/he has helped save through blood donation
> - Merchant and partner tie-ups to reward active members with special offers and discounts.
